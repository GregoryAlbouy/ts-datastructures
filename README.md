# TypeScript Datastructures

_Work in progress_

TypeScript implementation of common datastructures, as I previously did [with Golang](https://github.com/gregoryalbouy/go-datastructures).
As a huge Go enthusiast, I must admit that working with a language that support Generics is quite a relief. Can't wait for Go to implement them!

## Implemented

* Doubly Linked List
* Queue
* Stack
* Binary Search Tree (Todo: documentation)
