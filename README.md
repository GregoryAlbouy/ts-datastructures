# TypeScript Datastructures

_Work in progress_

Implementation of common data structures, TypeScript pendant of my [go-datastructures repo](https://github.com/gregoryalbouy/go-datastructures).
As a huge Go enthusiast, I must admit that working with a language that support Generics is quite a relief. (Can't wait for Go to implement them!)

## About

* :office: Understanding data structures
* :vertical_traffic_light: Keeping clean code and good coding practices
* :white_check_mark: Making relevant tests with high coverage rate
* :arrows_counterclockwise: Using Continuous Integration tools
* :blue_book: Maintaining a full documentation


## Implemented

* Doubly Linked List
* Queue
* Stack
* Binary Search Tree
* Graph *in progress*
