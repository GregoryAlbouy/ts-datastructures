# TypeScript Datastructures

_Work in progress_

My own TypeScript implementation of common datastructures, as I previously did [with Golang](https://github.com/gregoryalbouy/go-datastructures).
As a huge Go enthusiast, I must admit that working with a language that support Generics is quite a relief. Can't wait for Go to implement them!

## Implemented

* [Doubly Linked List](./src/list/)

## Todo

Everything.

* Setup package build & deploy routine with ci
* Documentation
* More data structures
* Benchmarks
